                    Idukki (ഇടുക്കി), IPA: [iɖukːi], is a district in the Indian state of Kerala.[4][5] It was constituted on 26 January 1972, by taking Peerumade, Udumbanchola, Devikulam taluks from Kottayam district and Thodupuzha taluk of Ernakulam district.[6] Its division was previously headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Kuyilimala near Painavu and Cheruthoni in June 1976. Idukki district lies amid the Cardamom Hills of Western Ghats in Kerala.

Though it is the second-largest district in the region in terms of area, it has the lowest population density among the districts of Kerala. There are only two municipalities in the district and the urban population is comparatively much lower than the rural population.

                            Hill View Park is located close to Idukki Dam and Cheruthoni Dam. The park is 350 feet above the water level of the dam. Hill View Park is located at a distance of 1.5 km from Idukki. The beautifully landscaped garden is spread over 8 acres. It also has a natural lake to add to its charm. As the name suggests, visitors can get a beautiful view of the environment from here. Deer, wild buffalo and elephants roam freely in their natural habitat. A boat ride through the lake will make the views of the forest a little closer and more vibrant. There is a garden of herbs and playgrounds where children can have fun. A visit to Idukki would not be complete without visiting Hill View Park.</p>
